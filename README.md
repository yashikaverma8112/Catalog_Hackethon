# Catalog Hackathon - Gauss Algorithm

This project is a solution to calculate the constant term \( c \) in a polynomial using a matrix-based method (Gaussian elimination).

## Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashikaverma8112/Catalog_Hackethon.git
   cd Catalog_Hackethon
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `Node.js` installed. Then, install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   Execute the `gauss.js` file to compute the constant term \( c \) using the provided input data:
   ```bash
   node gauss.js
   ```

4. **Modify input data**:
   To test with different values, edit the `input.json` file with new base and value pairs.
